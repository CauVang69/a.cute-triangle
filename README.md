LifeHack 2021-Education: As technology rapidly infiltrates the education sector and changes not just the way people learn, but also how people teach, what refreshing ideas do you have to make learning/teaching more safe, exciting, and effective?

OUR TEAM A.CUTE TRIANGLE CREATES A WEBPAGE TO HELP STUDENTS DISCOVER MORE ABOUT SCHOOL AND HELP STUDENTS SAVE SEARCHING TIME.
AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS MADE STUDENTS UNABLE TO VISIT THE SCHOOLS THEY ASPIRE TO STUDY IN. HOWEVER, SELF-RESEARCHING ONLINE BY STUDENTS CAN BE MISLEADING ON THE INTERNET FULL OF INFORMATION. HENCE, OUR WEBPAGE WILL OFFER OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACROSS ALL LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND ALSO REVIEW OF THE SCHOOLS
